# Perception of Acoustic Cues of Voiced Coronal Stops by Spanish-English Bilinguals

### Description:

The following script provides the analysis and data used for the study entitled Perception of Acoustic Cues of Voiced Coronal Stops by Spanish-English Bilinguals conducted by __[Ernesto Gutiérrez Topete](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/egutierrez)__ (UC Berkeley) and __[Jesus Duarte](https://www.spanport.ucla.edu/person/jesus-duarte/)__ (UC Los Angeles). This script was made available prior to the conference presentation of this research study in the 97th Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (2023, Denver, CO). Nonetheless, this script may be modified following the feedback and suggestions received from colleagues during this meeting or others.

The study explored Spanish-English bilinguals' perceptual discrimination of voiced coronal stop stimuli that were manipulated in regard to their voice onset time (VOT) and place of articulation (POA), in accordance to the acoustic properties related to each language: Spanish and English. The analysis included a regularization method that is intended to decrease the error reported by the statistical model in order to accommodate to a data set with a large number of variables.
